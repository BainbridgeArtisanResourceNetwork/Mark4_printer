<summary>Called to home the Z axis. Currently lowers the heated bed looking for an endstop switch at the bottom of the Z travel (max Z). Then z=0 is defined by the Z travel limit set in config.g. We should look at switching to using the Z-probe as the homing point (and keep the lower z-endstop as asafety switch). The new process would be to check if X and Y were homes, and if not, home them first. Then move to a position where the Z-probe os over the center of the printable area of the bed and find the probe trigger like we did with the X and Y. This can avoid dropping the bed all the way down adn running it back up.  </summary>
