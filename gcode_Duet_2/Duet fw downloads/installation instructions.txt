If you are updating update from something older than 3.0, you MUST UPDATE TO 3.0 FIRST.

Copy the file "Duet2 and 3Firmware-3.0.zip" the sys directory on the SD card using the web interface. The system should ask if you want to install the new fw. Say yes.


If you are already at 3.0 or higher, you should follow the same procedure for teh latest fw zip package.
