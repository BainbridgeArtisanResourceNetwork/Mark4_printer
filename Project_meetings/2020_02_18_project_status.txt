	Agenda Items:
		
		WOOD PROTO 
			- We had a great time putting together a lot of the parts that go onto the wool version fo our top plate. This inscluded the Y-Axis guide rails, a laser-cut laminated bridge, and an X-rail borrowed from Doug.  Ralph worked on getting two motors wired up. 
			- CNC machined parts: Clayton completed cutting all the standoffs in the metal studio. The bolts to hold these to the top plate are transit to us. Next up is getting the brackets for the Z-rails completed, but we dont have the Z-posts yet (in transit) or the two remaining Z-rails we need (not in stock, I'm looking for an alternate source. We also had a good discussion with David from metals about how to fab the "mega-nuts" we'll need to hold the Z-rails to the posts, and now have a good plan for them. 
			- Parts on-hand and inbound parts update from Mike. The power supply is here, along with the the drive gears. NEMA 23 motors are inboud, as are all the nuts and bolts. Also the 12mm guide rails for the bridge and the small sliding block for that rail. Posts are on order and should ship at the end of the week.
			- Power-up plan. We made good progress today, and will probably get gears moving next week.
			
			- Alternate idea for the mega-nut. We discussed and shot sown an idea to switch the Z-rails from 15mm to 12mm that involved a different design for the mega nut. 



NEXT MEETING
	Meeting date: 2/25 9am, ETA studio.
	Agenda: 
		- Wood proto - not sure we'll get through all of this. Much might get doen during open-studio time. 
			- Add more parts to the proto - pulleys on standoffs, motors pulleys on the wood-bridge.
			- Wire up the X and Y motors to the Duet 2 board
			- Turn on the Duet and see if we can configure the motors and make them turn
			- Launch a simple gcode file to make some controlled movement. 




OLD STUFF

			
		DESIGN REVIEW (from previous meetings)
			We reviewed the current model and identified the following changes/observations:
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: Belt tensioner seems complicated compared to doing something where the belts terminate at the carriage. Clayton to look into some design options.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The top enclosure looks very bulky. We'll look at it more carefully once we get the wood proto in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The bottom enclosure material needs to be selected so a more detailed design can be made. Doug suggested looking at the Jubilee insulation material. Mike suggested a sheet metal enclosure with fiberglass insulation might be good. Lots of work to do once the wood proto is in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: We need to start thinking about where the electric/electronic components will go.


		PROPOSED DECISIONS WAITING FOR LOCK UNTIL AFTER THE WOODEN PROTO IS BUILT

			PROPOSED DECISION:  Extruder - Bondtech BMG-X2 or clone, Hotend - Mosquito or clone
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark's recommendation
				Implications:
					- After the meeting, pricing these parts helped push us over budget. The dual-material BMG-X2 is $135 from Bondtech and we have not found a clone yet. And the Mosquito hot ends are $144 each.	
					
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the  Duet2 (or clone) as the controlelr and the Paneldu touchscreen (or clone) as the main user interface
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark has agreed to donate a Duet2 to the project, a big savings in the budget.
				Implications:
					- 	The Duet2 may not have support for an eventual tool-changer, and the Duet3 (which does support a toolchanger) does not use the Paneldu touchscreen. A future upgrade will waste the $100 Paneldu. 

			PROPOSED DECISION: Use a three-post frame. One leg at the center-rear, and one on each side towards the front. The posts align with the Z-support rails (so the rails can be fastened to them. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the forces that will try to deflect the top plate. A 4-point support can flex the top plate if teh legs are not all the same length.
				Implications:
					- Less parts!
					- We may need to have diagonal bracing between the three posts and the top plate to keep the assembled frame from racking.
					- Other things (like the lower eclosure) should not be fastened to the top in a rigid way.
					- As a contingency, keep the holes in the base and top plate for the rear corner posts. 
										
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the belt arrangement as implemented in the current model. This is the Mark3 arrangement with the Y-rails moved closer together. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the length of the bridge.
				Implications:
					- Taller idler pulley standoffs than the Mark3 design. We have protottypes of these idler pulley assemblies and they seem fine. 
		
			PROPOSED DECISION: As much as possible (hopefully 100%), use through bolts to fasten things to the plates,and not have threaded holes in the plates. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Threads in aluminum can be stripped, through bolts can be tighter, and through bolts can use locking nuts.
				Implications:
					- Longer bolts. 
				

					

		PENDING INVESTIGATION
			List of things we still need to look at. No decisions yet on any changes - we need to model the ideas so we can evaluate them. Here's the current list:

				1. Need to detail the design of the lower enclosure and the upper enclosure.
				2. Need to investigate  "closing the ring" and having the top plate span the front of the printer. Also allows locating the tool docks on this front edge and spinning the carraige by 180. This all would provide easier access to the tools and better visibility to the extruder when a part is printing. 
				3. Power analysis - look at the power (current/voltage) needs of all the bits and pieces in the design and assess how they all fit into the Duet2 design.
