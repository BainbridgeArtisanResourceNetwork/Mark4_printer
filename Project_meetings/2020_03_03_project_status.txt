	Status on Agenda Items:
		
		DUET 2 REPORT
			- Raplh reported that he's gotten the Duet 2 working. During the meeting he got it connected to the ETA network, then he and Doug worked out a bunch of configuration seetings for our printer design. They had motors turning on the bench, and eventually, on the wood proto!
		
		
		WOOD PROTO
			- It was a great day for finding bugs. Luckily, none was the Corona Virus....  We got all the pulleys and belts assembled, added some prototype belt tensioners, then hooked up the Duet and moved the motors. Good news is that the X and Y end stop switches worked beautifully. Bad news is we ran out of time before figuring out how to move the carriage in a controlled manner.
			
			- New bridge design. We decided not to switch to the new bridge design until we put the first design together and looked for bugs. 	

			- It's got legs! We installed the production legs on the wood proto, so now we can see the full size of the printer - it's big!
			
			- Bugs. This is a partial list, the full list is being submitted to github.
				- Need physical stops on the Z rails to prevent the sliding blocks frmo accidentally running off the ends of the rails. (Already submitted)
				- Noticeable racking of the frame. Not certain if this is strictly due to the top and bottom plates being made of wood, or if it's a fundamental design flaw.  We may not know for sure until the aluminum paltes are made.
				- We need a new design for how the belts are captured on the carraige. Connecting both under a single fastener did not work. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Total redesign on the way. Need to fasten easily, one side at a time, in teh correct vertical position. 
				- Bringing the belts into "high" tension puts a torque on the standoffs. We saw several effects - Flexing of the whole top-plate, and crushing of the fibers in the plywood bridge where. Once the pulleys lean even a little, the belts ride towards one end of the pulley and one even rode ofer the flange. Current plan (maybe there is a better one?) is to make aluminum end pieces for the bridge where the pulley standoffs land.
				- Tensioners as designed do not have enough movement to add desired tension. Not clear if this is becaus the belts are too stretchy, or the wood top plate is too flexy, or we just need more movement. We may need to create a belt stretch test to find the spring constant of the belt. 
			
			- Discussed using cast aluminum for the bottom plate vs a cheaper piece of 6061. The argumetn in favor of cast is that we'll have a second piece of aluminum we can use for a second top-plate if we hit some late design snags. Buying two at teh same time may save us on shipping costs. Mike to analyze.
			


NEXT MEETING
	Meeting date: 3/10 9am, ETA studio.
	Agenda: 
		- Duet2 report - Ralph
		- Wood proto -  
			- See what replacement parts we are able to get in hand by next week, and put them on. 
			- Continued experimentation with the motor controller. 
			- Find more bugs.
 




OLD STUFF

			
		DESIGN REVIEW (from previous meetings)
			We reviewed the current model and identified the following changes/observations:
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: Belt tensioner seems complicated compared to doing something where the belts terminate at the carriage. Clayton to look into some design options.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The top enclosure looks very bulky. We'll look at it more carefully once we get the wood proto in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The bottom enclosure material needs to be selected so a more detailed design can be made. Doug suggested looking at the Jubilee insulation material. Mike suggested a sheet metal enclosure with fiberglass insulation might be good. Lots of work to do once the wood proto is in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: We need to start thinking about where the electric/electronic components will go.


		PROPOSED DECISIONS WAITING FOR LOCK UNTIL AFTER THE WOODEN PROTO IS BUILT

			PROPOSED DECISION:  Extruder - Bondtech BMG-X2 or clone, Hotend - Mosquito or clone
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark's recommendation
				Implications:
					- After the meeting, pricing these parts helped push us over budget. The dual-material BMG-X2 is $135 from Bondtech and we have not found a clone yet. And the Mosquito hot ends are $144 each.	
					
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the  Duet2 (or clone) as the controlelr and the Paneldu touchscreen (or clone) as the main user interface
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark has agreed to donate a Duet2 to the project, a big savings in the budget.
				Implications:
					- 	The Duet2 may not have support for an eventual tool-changer, and the Duet3 (which does support a toolchanger) does not use the Paneldu touchscreen. A future upgrade will waste the $100 Paneldu. 

			PROPOSED DECISION: Use a three-post frame. One leg at the center-rear, and one on each side towards the front. The posts align with the Z-support rails (so the rails can be fastened to them. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the forces that will try to deflect the top plate. A 4-point support can flex the top plate if teh legs are not all the same length.
				Implications:
					- Less parts!
					- We may need to have diagonal bracing between the three posts and the top plate to keep the assembled frame from racking.
					- Other things (like the lower eclosure) should not be fastened to the top in a rigid way.
					- As a contingency, keep the holes in the base and top plate for the rear corner posts. 
										
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the belt arrangement as implemented in the current model. This is the Mark3 arrangement with the Y-rails moved closer together. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the length of the bridge.
				Implications:
					- Taller idler pulley standoffs than the Mark3 design. We have protottypes of these idler pulley assemblies and they seem fine. 
		
			PROPOSED DECISION: As much as possible (hopefully 100%), use through bolts to fasten things to the plates,and not have threaded holes in the plates. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Threads in aluminum can be stripped, through bolts can be tighter, and through bolts can use locking nuts.
				Implications:
					- Longer bolts. 
				

					

		PENDING INVESTIGATION
			List of things we still need to look at. No decisions yet on any changes - we need to model the ideas so we can evaluate them. Here's the current list:

				1. Need to detail the design of the lower enclosure and the upper enclosure.
				2. Need to investigate  "closing the ring" and having the top plate span the front of the printer. Also allows locating the tool docks on this front edge and spinning the carraige by 180. This all would provide easier access to the tools and better visibility to the extruder when a part is printing. 
				3. Power analysis - look at the power (current/voltage) needs of all the bits and pieces in the design and assess how they all fit into the Duet2 design.
