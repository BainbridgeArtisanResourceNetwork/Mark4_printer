	Status on Agenda Items:
	
		CORONA VIRUS SAFETY PROTOCOL
			1. Monitor wipes down all typical touch surfaces (keyboards, mice, 3D printer controls, table tops, door knobs, light switches, etc) before the studio opens.
			2. Anyone that feels ill at all should go home.
			3. ANyone that shows signs of illness will be asked to go home.
			4. Everyone is aasked to wash hands when entering the studio.
			5. Maintain social distancing - no more than one person per table.
			
		
		ELECTRICAL REPORT
			- Raplh reported that he's gtested teh board running long term (multipel hours and seen no unusual behavior with the board or the power supply. 
			- During the meeting, Raplh updated wiring to all of the motors and limit switches (except those for the Z axis). All were hooked up and Ralph adjusted a bunch of the parameters so the board would know which end of the rail the X and Y limit switchees are located on, the maximum travel on each axis (called the "soft-stop" because movement is stopped by SW, not a physical switch, etc. We were able to run the printer carriage in both the X and Y directions at will.
		
		
		WOOD PROTO
			- It was a great day for working around bugs. 
				- We hade some 3D printer replacements for the plywood bridge we used last week that allowed standoffs to tilt. The parts are working well, but we are still seeing standoffs on the MDF top plate tilting by having one edge dig into the MDF.  Wednesday next week (3/18) we are scheduled to meet with David in the metal studio to manfacture a proto bridge from aluminum.
				
				- We had a 3D printed replacement for the belt fasteners on the carriage. It worked pretty well, but a couple corners hit the nuts holding the X-rail to the bridge. We cut them back and may print a new design. Long term, we are planning to make an aluminum carriage.
				
				- We had a 3D printed part to hold the X-limit switch on the bridge, along with a new-style PC-board for teh switch. It worked. 
				
				- We took off the tensioners that we put on last week. 
				
				- We brain-stormed a plywood piece at the back side of the frame to hold all the electronics. Next week, we'll do a preliminary placement for all the parts.
			
		MORE PARTS ON PRDER
			- The cast aluminum plates for the top and bottom plates are on order. They should arrive ~3/20.
			- The mosquito hot end clone is on order from aliexpress. Guessing arrival ~3/23
			- The Duet expander board is on order from aliexpress. Guessing arrival ~3/23
			
		PARTS WE ARE WAITING FOR
			- The last two sliding rails we'll use for the Z-axis. Guessing arrival ~3/23 - 4/3. When they arrive, we'll want to have the aluminum brackets that hold the Z motors, and the heated bed kinematic supports. Also the kniematic supports themselves. Clayton is taking the lead on making the brackets. Mike will make the kinematic supports.
			


NEXT MEETING
	Meeting date: 3/18 9am, ETA studio.
	Agenda: 
		- Wood proto -  
			- Plan assembly of electric components on the plywood board, then put them on. Include the AC switch and safety covers for AC wiring.  
			- Continued experimentation with the motor controller. Mike will try to hae a pen holder tool so we can run G-code and see something happen.  
			- Start identifying features needed on the top plate to hold the tool holders and anything else we can think of. Want to get ramped up on all teh features needed on the aluminum top plate.
			- Find more bugs.
 




OLD STUFF

			
		DESIGN REVIEW (from previous meetings)
			We reviewed the current model and identified the following changes/observations:
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: Belt tensioner seems complicated compared to doing something where the belts terminate at the carriage. Clayton to look into some design options.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The top enclosure looks very bulky. We'll look at it more carefully once we get the wood proto in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: The bottom enclosure material needs to be selected so a more detailed design can be made. Doug suggested looking at the Jubilee insulation material. Mike suggested a sheet metal enclosure with fiberglass insulation might be good. Lots of work to do once the wood proto is in hand.
				- OBSERVATION 2/4: We need to start thinking about where the electric/electronic components will go.


		PROPOSED DECISIONS WAITING FOR LOCK UNTIL AFTER THE WOODEN PROTO IS BUILT

			PROPOSED DECISION:  Extruder - Bondtech BMG-X2 or clone, Hotend - Mosquito or clone
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark's recommendation
				Implications:
					- After the meeting, pricing these parts helped push us over budget. The dual-material BMG-X2 is $135 from Bondtech and we have not found a clone yet. And the Mosquito hot ends are $144 each.	
					
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the  Duet2 (or clone) as the controlelr and the Paneldu touchscreen (or clone) as the main user interface
				Proposed on:  12/3, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Mark has agreed to donate a Duet2 to the project, a big savings in the budget.
				Implications:
					- 	The Duet2 may not have support for an eventual tool-changer, and the Duet3 (which does support a toolchanger) does not use the Paneldu touchscreen. A future upgrade will waste the $100 Paneldu. 

			PROPOSED DECISION: Use a three-post frame. One leg at the center-rear, and one on each side towards the front. The posts align with the Z-support rails (so the rails can be fastened to them. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the forces that will try to deflect the top plate. A 4-point support can flex the top plate if teh legs are not all the same length.
				Implications:
					- Less parts!
					- We may need to have diagonal bracing between the three posts and the top plate to keep the assembled frame from racking.
					- Other things (like the lower eclosure) should not be fastened to the top in a rigid way.
					- As a contingency, keep the holes in the base and top plate for the rear corner posts. 
										
			PROPOSED DECISION: Use the belt arrangement as implemented in the current model. This is the Mark3 arrangement with the Y-rails moved closer together. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: We want to minimize the length of the bridge.
				Implications:
					- Taller idler pulley standoffs than the Mark3 design. We have protottypes of these idler pulley assemblies and they seem fine. 
		
			PROPOSED DECISION: As much as possible (hopefully 100%), use through bolts to fasten things to the plates,and not have threaded holes in the plates. 
				Proposed on:  1/21, will lock after wood prototype is built and evaluated.
				Rationale: Threads in aluminum can be stripped, through bolts can be tighter, and through bolts can use locking nuts.
				Implications:
					- Longer bolts. 
				

					

		PENDING INVESTIGATION
			List of things we still need to look at. No decisions yet on any changes - we need to model the ideas so we can evaluate them. Here's the current list:

				1. Need to detail the design of the lower enclosure and the upper enclosure.
				2. Need to investigate  "closing the ring" and having the top plate span the front of the printer. Also allows locating the tool docks on this front edge and spinning the carraige by 180. This all would provide easier access to the tools and better visibility to the extruder when a part is printing. 
				3. Power analysis - look at the power (current/voltage) needs of all the bits and pieces in the design and assess how they all fit into the Duet2 design.
